# GandCDataAssignment
All the work for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Week 4 Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is collect, work with, and clean a data set.  This repository will include: 1) a tidy data set as described
below, 2) a script called run_analysis.R for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any
transformations I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.  
 
The script does the following in the order specified
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Renames the activity entries, which are provided as numbers to descriptive names
Provides meaningful labels for the variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Most will find my code overly tedious as I find it hard to do multiple things with one command so I use many different ones. I also don't
reuse names very often as I try to use names that remind me of where I am in the process. I do use a great deal of comments though so
hopefully in the end my code is easy to understand if a bit verbose.
